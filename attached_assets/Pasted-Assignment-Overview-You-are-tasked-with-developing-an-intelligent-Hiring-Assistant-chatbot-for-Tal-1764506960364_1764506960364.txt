Assignment Overview
You are tasked with developing an intelligent Hiring Assistant chatbot for "TalentScout," a fictional recruitment agency specializing in technology placements. The chatbot should assist in the initial screening of candidates by gathering essential information and posing relevant technical questions based on the candidate's declared tech stack. This project will allow you to demonstrate your understanding of LLM’s

II. Purpose of Prompting 
The candidate will design prompts that guide the underlying language model to:
Gather Initial Candidate Information: Collect essential details such as name, contact information, years of experience, and desired positions.
Generate Technical Questions: Based on the candidate’s specified tech stack (e.g., programming languages, frameworks, tools), generate relevant technical questions to assess their proficiency.
Ensure Coherent and Context-Aware Interactions: Maintain the flow of conversation and context to provide a seamless user experience.

III. Requirements
Functionality
User Interface:
Develop a clean and intuitive UI using Streamlit or Gradio where candidates can interact with the chatbot.
Chatbot Capabilities:
Greeting: The chatbot should greet candidates upon initiation and provide a brief overview of its purpose. The chatbot should also exit whenever a conversation-ending keyword is encountered.
Information Gathering:
Collect essential candidate details such as:
Full Name
Email Address
Phone Number
Years of Experience
Desired Position(s)
Current Location
Tech Stack
Tech Stack Declaration:
Prompt candidates to specify their tech stack, including programming languages, frameworks, databases, and tools they are proficient in.
Technical Question Generation:
Based on the declared tech stack, generate a set of 3-5 technical questions tailored to assess the candidate’s proficiency in each specified technology.
Example: If a candidate lists Python and Django, generate questions related to Python programming and Django framework.
Context Handling:
Maintain the context of the conversation to handle follow-up questions and ensure a coherent flow.
Fallback Mechanism:
Provide meaningful responses when the chatbot does not understand the user input or when unexpected inputs are received.
It should not deviate from the Purpose.
End Conversation:
Gracefully conclude the conversation, thanking the candidate and informing them about the next steps.
Technical Specifications
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Tools:
Streamlit: For developing the frontend interface.
Large Language Models: Utilize pre-trained models (e.g., GPT-3/4, llama, etc).
Deployment:
Local deployment is acceptable.
Bonus points for Deploying on a cloud platform  (e.g. AWS, GCP, etc) and providing a live demo link.
Prompt Engineering
Design Effective Prompts:
Craft prompts that accurately gather candidate information and generate relevant technical questions based on the declared tech stack.
Ensure prompts are clear, concise, and guide the language model to produce desired outputs.
Optimize for Diverse Tech Stacks:
Handle a variety of technologies and frameworks, ensuring questions are relevant and appropriately challenging.
Manage Sensitive Information:
Implement techniques to handle and store sensitive candidate information securely and in compliance with data privacy best practices.
Data Handling
Simulated Data:
Use simulated or anonymized data for any backend processes, such as storing candidate information and technical responses.
Data Privacy:
Ensure that all candidate data is handled in compliance with data privacy standards (e.g., GDPR).
Documentation
README File:
Project Overview: Brief description of the Hiring Assistant chatbot and its capabilities.
Installation Instructions: Detailed steps to set up and run the application locally.
Usage Guide: Clear and Concise Readme file.
Technical Details: Libraries used, model details, and architectural decisions.
Prompt Design: Explanation of how prompts were crafted to handle information gathering and technical question generation.
Challenges & Solutions: Discuss any challenges faced during development and how they were addressed.
Code Quality
Structure & Readability:
Ensure the code is well-structured, modular, and follows best practices for readability and maintainability.
Documentation:
Include comments and docstrings where necessary to explain complex logic and functions.
Version Control:
Use Git for version control, with clear commit messages and a well-organized repository.
